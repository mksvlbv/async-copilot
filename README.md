# Async Copilot

**Visible staged triage for support teams under pressure. Messy case in, structured response pack out.**

Live demo: **https://async-copilot.vercel.app**

A full-stack portfolio demo that shows a support-triage pipeline end-to-end: landing page → case intake → live-run signature screen → completed response pack. Built with Next.js 15 App Router, Supabase (Postgres), and Tailwind.

---

## Try it

1. Open the landing — https://async-copilot.vercel.app
2. Click **Open App** → intake form
3. Click the **Payments Dispute — Duplicate Charge** scenario card (golden path)
4. Hit **Start Triage** → watch the 6-stage timeline progress in real time
5. When it reaches terminal state (~5 sec), inspect the Response Pack, **Approve Pack & Queue Actions**, or **Export Pack** (markdown download)
6. Navigate to **Runs** or **Samples** in the header to browse

Try **Paste** instead: type or paste your own case body in the textarea → it still creates a real case + run with a generic fallback response pack.

## Surfaces

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Marketing landing — 7 sections (header, hero + workspace mockup, how-it-works, system trust, response pack showcase, closing CTA, footer) |
| `/app` | **New Case** intake form + live sample picker |
| `/app/runs/[runId]` | **Live Triage Run** signature screen: Case Context / Visible Triage / Response Pack (polling → terminal → approve / export) |
| `/app/runs` | Runs list with live search, state chip filters, progress + confidence columns |
| `/app/samples` | Scenario library — Golden Path + Alternatives, with body preview |
| `/api/health` | Machine-readable env + schema + row-count snapshot |
| `/api/samples` · `/api/cases` · `/api/runs` · `/api/runs/[id]` | REST endpoints |
| `/api/runs/[id]/advance` · `/approve` · `/export` | Run lifecycle mutations + export |

## Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript, typedRoutes, `next/font/google`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4 with design tokens extracted from Variant exports
- **Icons**: `@phosphor-icons/react` (server-side rendered SVG)
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres 17 (`eu-west-1` / Ireland)
- **Auth client**: `@supabase/ssr` (browser + server), `@supabase/supabase-js` (admin)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Stockholm edge, auto-deploy on every push to `main`)
- **E2E**: Playwright (`tests/golden-path.spec.ts`)

---

## Data model

5 tables, 4 enums, permissive RLS (writes gated through server routes using the secret key):

- `samples` — curated scenario library (read-only in UI)
- `cases` — support-case instances, from intake or materialized from a sample
- `runs` — triage lifecycle (`pending` → `running` → `completed`/`escalated`)
- `run_stages` — 6 stages per run with `output` JSON blobs + `duration_ms`
- `response_packs` — final artifact (confidence, recommendation, summary, draft reply, citations, staged actions)

Schema: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
Seeds: `supabase/seeds/001_samples.sql` + `002_golden_run.sql`

## Run locally

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Fill .env.local (copy .env.example)
#    Three Supabase env vars required:
#      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
#      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
#      SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY
#      SUPABASE_DB_URL   (for migrations only — server-side)

# 3. One-shot migrate + seed
npm run db:init

# 4. Start dev
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000

# 5. Run E2E against prod (or BASE_URL=... for preview/local)
npm run test:e2e
```

Useful scripts:

- `npm run typecheck` — strict TypeScript
- `npm run build` — production build (all 14 routes)
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run db:migrate` · `npm run db:seed` — split init

---

## Key design decisions

- **Server-owned run progression** — every `/advance` call is authoritative on the server. Client polls, client never mutates state directly.
- **Polling over realtime** — `800ms` cadence; stops on terminal state. Simpler than websockets, good enough for a demo.
- **R21 scope boundary** — no auth, no real integrations, no autonomous action. Staged actions stay `queued` until a human clicks Approve.
- **Idempotent schema + seeds** — `npm run db:init` is safe to re-run. Demo environment can be reset cheaply.
- **One source of design truth** — `docs/design/design-system.md` holds all tokens; every screen pulls from there.

## Deployment

- Every push to `main` → Vercel build → production deploy (~45 sec).
- Env vars are stored in Vercel encrypted storage (Development / Preview / Production).
- Supabase URL/keys are pulled at runtime via `process.env.*`.
